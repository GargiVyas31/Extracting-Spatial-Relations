# **Extracting-Spatial-Relations**
This code is a part of **"A Learning Ecosystem for Dyslexics"** - web application to augment reading experience for the dyslexics. The main feature of this application is to extract sentences that encode spatial knowledge (placement of objects in 3D space) and render them as 3D scenes. The following code is about extracting those spatial relations from sentences and generating a **main_object-spatial_relation-reference_object** triplet. This triplet is then used to position objects in Blender Software.
